On the first down, an NFL player should stop shy of the first down marker unless they can make several extra yards on the play. The decision can be clarified by calculating implied yards per possession - a notion that may also help coordinators improve their second and third down strategy. 

This repo provides a notebook to reproduce the findings, and a draft paper. Enjoy.
