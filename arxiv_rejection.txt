Dear author,

Thank you for submitting your work to arXiv. We regret to inform you that arXiv’s moderators have determined that your submission will not be accepted and made public on [1]arXiv.org

Our moderators have determined that your submission is on a topic not covered by arXiv or that the intended audience for your work is not a community we currently serve.

For more information, please see [2]https://arxiv.org/help/moderation. 

arXiv moderators strive to balance fair assessment with decision speed. We understand that this decision may be disappointing, and we apologize that, due to the high volume of submissions arXiv receives, we cannot offer more detailed feedback. 

We appreciate your interest in arXiv and wish you the best.

Sincerely,

The arXiv Content Management
User Support Team
