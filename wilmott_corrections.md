### years -> yards

Then, the value of a yard can be inferred from field goal
kicking probability, for instance, 15 years might be
worth a point if it drops from 0.75 to 0.42, as we
move from a 45-yard attempt to a 60-yard shot.

("years" should be "yards") 
(comma to colon)

Preferred version: 

Then, the value of a yard can be inferred from field goal
kicking probability: for instance, 15 yards might be
worth a point if it drops from 0.75 to 0.42 as we
move from a 45-yard attempt to a 60-yard shot.

### Missing period
page 21 3rd paragraph 

We shall find that the second number exceeds
the first by as much as a factor of two. Players and,
by implication coaching staff, are putting far too
high a value on possession relative to yards

(should end with period)


### Missing 30

Third and one
Armed with the basic rule that possession
is worth yards, give or take, we return

Should read:

# Missing 48
Middle of page 11

The calculus for the 11-yard gain reads, which
is still way too high a value (in yards) to put on
possession. However, more detailed variations on
this calculation are presented in Cotton (2021),

Should be:

The calculus for the 11-yard gain implies 48 yards, which
is still way too high a value to put on
possession. However, more detailed variations on
this calculation are presented in Cotton (2021),

(note omission of second reference to yards)


# Missing number/wording change  
Right col page 11

Conversely, defensive players need not suffer
one extra concussion to bring about an abrupt
deceleration of the ball carrier. Let them get the
10 yards, or 11 if necessary. And the implication
extends beyond individual player decisions.
Offensive and defensive teams should design
plays to make the and yard gains more likely,
and the middle ground less so.
